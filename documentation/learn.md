There are many different forms of Assistive Technologies (AT). The scope of this website only covers AT that must interface with the code you write as a web developer. This means that AT like screen readers or voice control software are in scope, while AT such as hearing aids and screen magnifiers are not.

For a summary of similar commands across different types of AT, view the [command matrix](/learn/commands).

## AT Information

There are many different assistive technologies, but it would be impossible for us to test them all. Therefore [we only test the most widely used ones](/faq#what-assistive-technologies-are-in-scope%3F).

### Screen readers

Screen readers announce the content of the screen either by audio or by a braille device. People who are blind or have low vision are likely to use screen reader software to interact with computers or devices.

### Voice Control

Voice Control software allows users to command their computers or devices by voice, bypassing the need for a mouse or keyboard. People with physical or motor disabilities are most likely to use voice control software. [Differences between voice control software](/learn/vc_differences)
