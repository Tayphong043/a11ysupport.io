# Windows Speech Recognition

Windows Speech Recognition is a voice control system. It's an older solution, and is being replaced by [Windows Voice Access](/learn/at/va_windows).

There are 2 types of overlays that you can turn on.

* "show numbers" will turn on an overlay that displays a number for every element on the page. This is helpful when an element is missing a name, or if the user does not know how to pronounce a name.
* "mousegrid" will turn on an overlay that displays a numbered grid over the screen that allows the user to interact with parts of the screen that don't have names or numbers. For example, a user can zoom in on grid a grid number until it is large enough to cover an incorrectly coded icon button without a name or role, then pan the screen so that the number is over the button, and then say "click <number>" to activate the button.
