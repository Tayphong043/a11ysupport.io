# Windows Voice Access

Windows Speech Recognition is a modern voice control system. It appears to be replacing [Windows Speech Recognition](/learn/at/wsr).

There are 2 types of overlays that you can turn on.

* "show numbers" will turn on an overlay that displays a number for every element on the page. This is helpful when an element is missing a name, or if the user does not know how to pronounce a name.
* "grid" will turn on an overlay that displays a numbered grid over the screen that allows the user to interact with parts of the screen that don't have names or numbers. For example, a user can zoom in on grid a grid number until it is large enough to cover an incorrectly coded icon button without a name or role, then pan the screen so that the number is over the button, and then say "<number>" to activate the button.
